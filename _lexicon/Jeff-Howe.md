[Jeff Howe](http://www.leighbureaultd.com/speakers/JHowe/) explores the frontiers of our media and technology future and brings back valuable, vivid reports on the dangers and possibilities waiting for us there. He coined the term crowdsourcing in 2006 and published a book on the subject in 2008. Now, with his new book [Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future](https://whiplashbook.com/), which he wrote together with [Joi Ito](https://metacaugs.github.io/lexicon/Joi-Ito/), he shows us how to navigate the exponential acceleration of everything digital and its white water confluence with the Internet. Jeff Howe is a visiting scholar at the MIT Media Lab and an assistant professor and the program coordinator for Media Innovation at Northeastern University.
