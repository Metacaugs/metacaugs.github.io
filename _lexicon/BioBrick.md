[BioBrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioBrick) parts are DNA sequences which conform to a restriction-enzyme assembly standard.[1][2] These building blocks are used to design and assemble larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts and combinations of parts with defined functions, which would then be incorporated into living cells.
