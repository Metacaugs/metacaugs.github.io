**Metacognition** is “[cognition] about cognition”, “thinking about
thinking”, or “knowing about knowing” and higher order thinking skills.
It comes from the root word [meta], meaning beyond.[1] It
can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use
particular strategies for learning or for problem solving. [1] There are
generally two components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition,
and regulation of cognition.[1]
