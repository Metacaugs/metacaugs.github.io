[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a visual programming language for kids and young people, developed at the MIT. 
It's also a worldwide community of young programmers and instructors. The [Scratch Foundation](https://www.scratchfoundation.org/) supports the mission, 
which is defined as engaging "young people in thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, and working collaboratively -- essential skills for everyone in today's society."
