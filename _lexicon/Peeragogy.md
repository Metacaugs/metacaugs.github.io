Peeragogy is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning and peer knowledge production. 
The [Peeragogy Handbook](http://peeragogy.github.io/) is a compendium of know how for any group of people who want to co-learn any subject together, 
when none of them is an expert in the particular subject matter.
