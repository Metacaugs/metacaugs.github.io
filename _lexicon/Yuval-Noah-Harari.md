[Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari) (born 24 February 1976) is an Israeli historian and a tenured professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is the author of the international bestseller Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2014) and of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2015). 
Harari gives interesting insights into what we, human beings, are and what we are not. He starts out from the dawn of civilization and discusses the end of the Homo Sapiens. This is very relevant in the discussions about AI and cyborgs.
