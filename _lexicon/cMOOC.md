A cMOOC is a type of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)

cMOOCs are based on principles from connectivist pedagogy indicating that material should be aggregated (rather than pre-selected), remixable, re-purposable, and feeding forward (i.e. evolving materials should be targeted at future learning). cMOOC instructional design approaches attempt to connect learners to each other to answer questions and/or collaborate on joint projects. This may include emphasizing collaborative development of the MOOC. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course#cMOOCs_and_xMOOCs))
