[Time Well Spent](http://www.timewellspent.io) is a movement to align technology with our humanity. 
The founding father of the movement is [Tristan Harris](http://www.tristanharris.com/). Harris, a 
philosopher-designer, claims networks such as Facebook and Netflix want to keep us on their properties.
They are not interested in really making our own time and life better.
The design principles of such sites and apps only reflect the corporate interests of the companies involved.

Harris promotes other design principles, inciting people to have better lives (by spending more time offline). He also 
want to make people aware of the specific design choices which influence consumers.
