systems of thought and knowledge (epistemes or discursive formations, in Foucaultâ€™s terminology) 
are governed by rules, beyond those of grammar and logic, that operate beneath the consciousness of individual subjects 
and define a system of conceptual possibilities that determines the boundaries of thought in a given domain and period. 
(Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy about the French philosopher [Michel Foucault](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/#4.2))
