To create a new lexicon page, just create a new Markdown file here on GitHub in the _lexicon folder. Then, make sure to include the following metadata at the top of the file before you write the actual content. Only the title is mandatory, the other metadata can be left blank.
```
---
layout: lexicon
title:
categories:
tags:
metamaps_link:
