To create a new lexicon page, just create a new Markdown file here on GitHub in the _lexicon folder. Then, make sure to include the following metadata at the top of the file before you write the actual content.
```
---
layout: lexicon
title: [insert page title here]
categories: [insert categories here]
tags:  [insert tags here]
---
```
