## Attention! This is a work in progress.

Contribute to [this shared Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYhrFJtmYzbRxh9VIVgF1ZQFc1UmQk_NnecT2JCmtl8) for now instead... we will upload a more polished version here to GitHUb once that emerges.... Or at least this will act as a nice link... and you can work from wherever you like  :P

- Get an invite for [metacaugs.slack.com](https://metacaugs.slack.com/)
- Slack has channels on the left handside. Head to the channel **Introductions** to introduce yourself. Talking about Slack, it's worthwhile to [familiarize yourself with this tool](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users), for instance learning how to filter the information streams on your mobile and laptop computer.
- The channel **announcements** contains the practical stuff such as when which event takes place and how to get there. 
- **Whiplash_discussion** is about the book we're currently reading, written by Joi Ito and Jeff Howe. **Lexicon** is about our Lexicon on Metamaps and GitHub. You will find summaries of the chapters we already discussed. In a previous series we discussed the book Thank You for Being Late by Thomas Friedman, these discussions are now a useful background. The [New York Times has this review of the book](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/books/review/thomas-friedman-thank-you-for-being-late.html?_r=0). 
- **Infood** is the place to go when you want to share of find interesting stuff you read or watch. 
- Since part of the exercise is making decisions together, you'll want to be part of **_decision-making**. 
- Don't hesitate asking around if you need help on Slack - there are many more channels. 
- There is one main **weekly synchronous meeting**, as for now on Sunday evening - 9 pm Brussels time and 3 pm EST. You'll find the link to GoToMeeting in the announcements channel. Check you audio and video and preferably use a headset. A recording is available afterwards and before the meeting starts there is a chapter summary text. 
- Volunteer for one of the **roles** during and after the meeting: summarizer, contextualizer, lexicon wizard, mindmapper, blogger... 
- We encourage you to familiarize yourself with [MetaMaps](https://metamaps.cc/) for [general mindmapping about the course](https://metamaps.cc/maps/2806) and [the lexicon](https://metamaps.cc/maps/2814) and with [GitHub](https://github.com/Metacaugs) for the [blogging](https://metacaugs.github.io/) and the [lexicon](https://metacaugs.github.io/lexicon/) again. While GitHub may seem intimidating, we made it relatively easy to use. Also, GitHub is a very important example of a platform for collaboration so it's worthwhile to experiment there. 
- [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) is a nice way to prepare documents for GitHub or other places. Just like on GitHub the texts are writting in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - think of it like a simple version of html (it can be converted into html). There are many [cheatsheets for markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and there is one integrated in hackmd (the question mark above your text input field). 
- Your blogposts will be part of our [Metacaugs blog](https://metacaugs.github.io/) on GitHub. To create your blog you will have to hit **create a new file** [on this page](https://github.com/Metacaugs/metacaugs.github.io/tree/master/_posts). Be sure to read the readme.md file with simple but necessary instructions. 
- This is our [lexicon on GitHub](https://metacaugs.github.io/lexicon/). To add stuff **create new file** on [this page](https://github.com/Metacaugs/metacaugs.github.io/tree/master/_lexicon), again read the readme.md file. At first some things may go wrong (maybe you'll forget to put .md after the filename, maybe you forgot to leave a space behind a colon in the metadata) - just ask in Slack and people will come to the rescue. 
- This is a [video tutorial for MetaMaps](https://youtu.be/0Bd8XxlNG3U). 

- There are many other tools and platforms which are being suggested. If you get overwhelmed, focus on the essential ones.

## SUMMARY

**Get on Slack, start reading, participate in the weekly meetings, do some writing and mindmapping using tools such as Metamaps, GitHub, Hackmd, try out some extra tools and find out how you will make the world a better place.**
