This readme is a good place to give tips on how to write a blog post using Jekyll.

To make a blog post, create a new file and name it something like `_posts/2017-03-24-Blog-Post-Name.md` (If you choose to create the file while already inside the `_posts` folder then you don't need to bother adding that bit into the file's name)

How you name the file determines the Title of the post… and also the preceeding date is important too. (It won’t show up as a “post” if it isn’t in this format)

This readme isn't done.... it #needswork
