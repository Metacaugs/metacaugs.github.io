This readme is a good place to give tips on how to write a blog post using Jekyll.

To make a blog post, create a new file in this folder and name it something like `2017-03-24-Blog-Post-Name.md` 

How you name the file determines the Title of the post (dashes are converted to spaces), and including the date in the file name is important too. (It won’t show up as a “post” if it isn’t in this format)

This readme isn't done.... it #needswork
