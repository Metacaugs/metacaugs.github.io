[QIARK](https://www.qiark.com/) is one of the projects Metacaugs tries to help as an accelerator. QIARK, is a platform that aims to crowdsource answers to questions by amplifying the intelligence and judgment capacity of individuals and groups. The platform is currently being beta tested and has a patent pending in the US.
They raised £121,220 on [Crowdcube](https://www.crowdcube.com/companies/impact-ri-limited/pitches/lGyJxb), exceeding the target of £99,750. 
 attend [Hack Belgium](http://www.hackbelgium.be/), with the QIARK-system. The conference Hack Belgium is held from the 4th to the 6th of May in Brussels, with the organisers hoping to transform Brussels during three days into a laboratory of the future, hacking the disruptive possibilities of technological change. 

Hacking is described as a way of finding highly creative and unorthodox solutions to problems that currently can’t be solved by conventional means’. People from very diverse industries will explore new possibilities, develop concrete projects (supported by mentors) and present their ideas. 

QIARK is also hoping to be part of the Zurich TedX conference in November as it is already understood for its potential to crowdsource answers to questions by amplifying the intelligence and judgment capacity of individuals and groups, helping them find those ‘unorthodox solutions’ which the organisers are hoping to find.
